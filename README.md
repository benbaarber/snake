# Snake

Created a deep Q network and hooked it up to a simple snake game with a pygame display. Implemented ray tune to tune hyperparameters with bayesian model-based optimization. After training over 50000 games with the optimized hyperparameters, was able to achieve scores of up to 20 on an 8x8 board.
